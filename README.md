# Intorduction to Using Python for Image Analysis
To get started using python the first step is the installation and there are several ways you can do it. To make it easier for your future self it's a good idea to set up a virtual environment. You can think of this as a virtual installation folder where you install all your python libraries (basically just functions that other people have written). One way to manage these environments is [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
